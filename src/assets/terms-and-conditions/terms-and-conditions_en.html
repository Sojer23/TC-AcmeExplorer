            <h1>Privacy Statement of Acme-Explorer.com</h1>
            <p>2019-05-02 18:26:11</p>
            <p>First things first – your privacy is important to us. We know that’s the kind of thing all these sorts of
                notices say, but frankly we mean it. You’ve placed your trust in us by using the Acme-Explorer.com services
                and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you
                give us. We act in our customers’ interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal
                data.</p>
            <p>
                This document describes how we use and process your personal data, hopefully provided in a readable and
                transparent manner so you can get where we’re coming from without getting bored senseless. As an added
                bonus, it also tells you how to contact us if you have questions about your personal data, which we’re
                more than happy to answer. Please also read our separate <a
                    href="https://www.Acme-Explorer.com/content/privacy.html#cookie-statement">Cookie Statement</a>, which
                tells you how Acme-Explorer.com makes use of cookies and other similar technologies. For a better
                understanding of what we mean by “Trip”, “Trip Provider”, “Trip Service” and “Trip Reservation”, please
                read the Acme-Explorer.com <a href="https://www.Acme-Explorer.com/content/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If you’ve ever used us before, you’ll know that Acme-Explorer.com offers online travel-related services through
                our own websites and mobile apps, as well as through other online platforms such as partners’ websites
                and social media. Why point that out, you ask? Well, here’s the thing. All the information that follows
                applies to not one, not two, but all of these platforms. Several platforms, one privacy statement.</p>
            <p>This one privacy statement applies to any kind of information we collect through these platforms or other
                means connected to these platforms (such as contacting our customer service team via email). It makes
                for a lot less tedious reading. If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also check out our
                Privacy Statement for Business Partners to understand how personal data is further processed as part of
                the business relationship.</p>
            <p>We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time. If you care about your privacy, visit this page
                regularly and you’ll know exactly where you stand. If we make changes to the Privacy Statement which
                will have an impact on you (for example, if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes
                than communicated in the past in this Privacy Statement), we will notify you of these changes before the
                new activities begin. </p>
            <p>Sad but necessary bit: If you disagree with this Privacy Statement, you should discontinue using our
                services. If you agree with our Privacy Statement, then you’re all set to book your next Trip through
                us. Let the good times roll!</p>

            <h2>What kind of personal data does Acme-Explorer.com collect?</h2>
            <p>We can’t help you book the perfect Trip without information, so when you use our services there are
                certain pieces of information we ask for. This is pretty basic stuff – your name, preferred contact
                details, the names of anybody travelling with you and your payment information. You may decide for
                yourself to submit special requests for your upcoming Trip (for example, certain preferences ). In
                addition to this, we also collect information from your computer, phone, tablet or other device you are
                using to access our services. This includes the IP address, the browser you use, and your language
                settings. There are also situations in which we receive information about you from others or
                automatically collect other information. This is the basic overview of the information we collect, but

            <h2>Why does Acme-Explorer.com collect and use your personal data?</h2>
            <p>The main reason we ask you for personal details is a pretty good one – it’s to help administer your

            <hr class=" privacy-divider ">
            <h2 id="policy-what">What kind of personal data does Acme-Explorer.com collect?</h2>
            <p>OK, so you’re looking for a bit more info. Here’s a more in-depth look at the information we collect.</p>
            <h3>Personal data you give to us. </h3>
            <p>Acme-Explorer.com collects and uses information which you provide to us. When you make a Trip Reservation, you
                are (as a minimum) asked for your name and email address. Depending on the Trip Reservation, we may also
                ask for your home address, telephone number, payment information, date of birth, the names of any guests
                travelling with you and any preferences (such as meal preferences and any mobility restrictions) you
                might have for your Trip.</p>
            <p>If you need to get in touch with our customer service team, or reach out to us through other means (such
                as through social media, or communicating with your booked Trip Provider through us) we will collect
                information from you there too. Guests can also be asked to provide a review to help ensure future
                guests get exactly what they’re looking for. We will collect information from you included in your
                reviews, including your display name and avatar if you choose one.</p>
            <p>There are also other instances where you’ll provide us with information. For example, if you’re browsing
                with your mobile device, you can decide to enable Acme-Explorer.com to see your current location or grant
                access to your contact details – this helps us provide you with the best possible service and experience
                (for example, to see our city guides, the nearest restaurants or attractions to your location or other
                recommendations). You can also open a user account, which allows you to save your personal settings,
                upload photos, review previous Acme-Explorers or plan and manage future reservations or benefit from other
                features only available to account holders (such as incentives or other benefits we may offer).
            </p>
            <p>You can decide to participate in referral programs or sweepstakes, and doing this will also mean
                providing us with personal data. In addition to that, you can provide us with feedback or ask for help
                with using the Acme-Explorer.com travel services.</p>
            <h3>Personal data you give us about others.</h3>
            <p>Of course, you might not simply be making a Trip Reservation for yourself. You may be doing a Trip with
                other guests whose details you provide as part of the Trip Reservation, or you may make a Trip
                Reservation on behalf of someone else. If you maintain a Acme-Explorer.com for Business account, you can also
                create an address book to facilitate business travel, as well as manage the Acme-Explorers of others. In some
                cases, you can use Acme-Explorer.com to share information with others. This might take the form of forwarding
                a wish list or participating in referral programs, but such information may only be used as described in
                the offered interface – check the details there if you want to know more.</p>
            <p>However, at this point we have to point out that it’s your responsibility to ensure that the person or
                people you have provided personal data about are aware that you’ve done so, and have understood and
                accepted how Acme-Explorer.com uses their information (as described in this Privacy Statement).</p>
            <h3>Personal data we collect automatically.</h3>
            <p>Even if you don’t end up making a Trip Reservation (and when you do), when you visit our websites or apps
                we automatically collect certain information. This includes your IP address, the date and time you
                accessed our services, the hardware, software or internet browser you use and information about your
                computer’s operating system, like application versions and your language settings. We also collect
                information about clicks and which pages have been shown to you.</p>
            <p>If you are using a mobile device, we collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific
                settings and characteristics, app crashes and other system activity. When you make a Trip Reservation,
                our system registers through which means and from which websites you have made your reservation or
                entered the Acme-Explorer.com websites and/or apps.</p>
            <h3>Personal data we receive from other sources.</h3>
            <p>It’s not just the things you tell us, though – we may also receive information about you from other
                sources. These include business partners, such as affiliate partners, subsidiaries of the Acme-Explorer.com
                corporate family and other affiliates of the Acme-Explorer Holdings Inc. corporate family (see also <a
                    href="#policy-Acme-Explorer-holdings">here</a>) and other independent third parties, and anything we get
                from them may be combined with information provided by you. For example, the Acme-Explorer.com reservation
                services are not only made available via Acme-Explorer.com and the Acme-Explorer.com apps, but are also integrated
                into services of affiliate partners you can find online. When you use some of these, you provide the
                reservation details to our business partner, who then forward your details to us. We also integrate
                third party service providers to facilitate payment between bookers and Trip Providers. These service
                providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your Trip Reservation, making sure
                everything goes as smoothly as possible for you.</p>
            <p>
                Another example is that we integrate communication services into our platforms to enable you to connect
                with the booked Trip Provider about your stay, and when we do we receive in some cases metadata about
                communication activities (such as where you called, who you are and the date and length of the call). We
                may also receive information about you to serve you more relevant advertisement for example additional
                cookie data made available to Acme-Explorer.com by social media partners. Please read under <a
                    href="https://www.Acme-Explorer.com/content/privacy.html#policy-why">Why does Acme-Explorer.com collect and use
                    your personal data?</a> for more information. When you link your Acme-Explorer.com user account to your
                social media account, personal data may be shared with Acme-Explorer.com by that social media provider, but
                only when it’s OK with you for them to do so. You always have the choice not to share this data.
            </p>
            <p>Trip Providers may share information about you with Acme-Explorer.com too – this may happen if you have support
                questions about your pending reservation, when disputes arise about a Trip Reservation (though naturally
                we don’t like it when that happens).</p>
            <p></p>
            <hr class=" privacy-divider ">
            <h2 id="policy-why">Why does Acme-Explorer.com collect and use your personal data?</h2>
            <p>We use the information collected about you for various purposes. Your personal data may be used in the
                following ways:</p>
            <div style="padding-left:40px">
                <p>A. Trip Reservations: First and foremost, we use your personal data to complete and administer your
                    online Trip Reservation, which is pretty central to what we do as a company! This includes sending
                    you communications in relation to your Trip Reservation such as confirmations, modifications and
                    reminders.</p>
                <p>B. Customer service: We provide international customer service from our local offices in more than 20
                    languages, and we’re there to help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Sharing your relevant details,
                    such as reservation information or information about your user account with our global customer
                    service staff allows us to respond when you need us – including helping you to find appropriate Trip
                    Provider and responding to any questions you might have about your Trip Reservation (or any other
                    queries, for that matter).</p>
                <p>C. Account facilities: Acme-Explorer.com users can create a user account on our websites or apps. We use
                    the information you give us to administer this account, allowing you to do a number of useful
                    things. You can manage your Trip Reservations, take advantage of special offers, make future Trip
                    Reservations easily and manage your personal settings. Managing personal settings can allow you to
                    keep and share lists, share photos, see previously searched Trip Services easily and to check other
                    travel-related information you have provided. It can also allow you to see any reviews you have
                    submitted. If you want, you can share certain information in your user account by creating a public
                    profile that’s associated with either your own first name or a screen name of your choice.
                    Acme-Explorer.com for Business account holders can save contact details in their account facility, manage
                    their business reservations and link other account holders to the Acme-Explorer.com for Business account.
                </p>
                <p>D. Online groups: We may enable users with an account to join and interact with each other through
                    online groups or forums.</p>
                <p>E. Marketing activities: We use your information for marketing activities. These activities include:

                    <li>

                            communication.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Based on your information, individualised offers may be shown to you on the Acme-Explorer.com
                            website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites/apps (including social media sites) and
                            the content of the site displayed to you may be personalized. These may be offers that you
                            can book directly on the Acme-Explorer.com site, or on co-branded sites, or other third-party
                            offers or products we think you might find interesting.</p>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>F. Communicating with you: There may be other times when we get in touch, including by email, by
                    post, by phone or by texting you – which method we choose depends on the contact information you’ve
                    previously shared with us. And we process the communications you send to us. There could be a number
                    of reasons for this, including:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Responding to and handling any requests you or your booked Trip Provider have made.

                            continue with your reservation. We believe that this additional service benefits you as it
                            allows you to carry on with a Trip Reservation without having to search for Trip Provider or
                            fill in your reservation details again.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>We also send you other material related to your Trip Reservations, such as how to contact

                            useful to you in planning or getting the best out of your Trip. We may also send you
                            material related to upcoming Trip Reservations or a summary of previous Trip Reservations
                            you made through Acme-Explorer.com.</p>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>G. Market research: We sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research. Please see the
                    information provided when you are invited to participate to understand what personal data is
                    collected and how your personal data is used further.</p>
                <p>H. Improving our services: We also use personal data for analytical purposes. This is part of our
                    drive to improve our services and enhance the user experience, but can also be used for testing
                    purposes, troubleshooting and to improve the functionality and quality of our online travel
                    services. The main goal here is to optimize and customize our online platform to your needs, making
                    our site easier and more enjoyable to use. We strive to only use pseudonymized data for these
                    analytical purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    I. Guest reviews and other destination-related information: During and after your Trip you book
                    through us, you may be invited to submit a review. We can also enable guests travelling with you or
                    on whose behalf you have booked to provide a review. This invite asks for information about the Trip
                    Provider or the destination.
                    Account holders can choose to display a review with a screen name instead of the real name (which
                    can be chosen in the user account facility). In addition to this, account holders can choose to
                    display a review anonymously. Adding an avatar is also possible. By completing a guest review, you
                    are agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our <a
                        href="https://www.Acme-Explorer.com/content/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>) on, for example, the
                    relevant Trip Provider information page on our websites, on our mobile apps, on our social media
                    accounts and social media apps, or on the online platform of the relevant Trip Provider or business
                    partner’s website. This is to inform other travellers about the quality of the Trip Service you
                    used, the destination you have chosen or other experiences you choose to share.
                </p>
                <p>
                    J. Call monitoring: When you make calls to our customer service team, Acme-Explorer.com uses an automated
                    telephone number detection system to relate your telephone number to your existing reservations –
                    this can help save time for both you and our customer support staff. Our customer service staff may
                    still ask for authentication, which ensures that your reservation details are kept confidential.
                    During calls with our customer service team, live listening may be done or calls may be recorded for
                    quality control and training purposes which includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of
                    claims and fraud detection purposes. Not all calls are recorded and recordings are kept for a
                    limited amount of time and automatically deleted thereafter, unless Acme-Explorer.com has a legitimate
                    interest to keep such recording for a longer period, including for fraud investigation and legal
                    purposes.
                </p>
                <p>K. Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service: In order to create a trustworthy environment for you,
                    your fellow travellers, Acme-Explorer.com’s business partners and our Trip Providers, we may use personal
                    data for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities. Similarly,
                    we may use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including the authentication of
                    users and reservations. For such purposes, we may have to stop certain reservations or put on hold
                    reservations until we have finished our assessment.</p>
                <p>L. Legal purposes: Finally, in certain cases, we may need to use your information to handle and
                    resolve legal disputes, for regulatory investigations and compliance, to enforce the terms of use of
                    the Acme-Explorer.com online reservation service or to comply with lawful requests from law enforcement.
                </p>
                <p>Providing your personal data to Acme-Explorer.com is voluntary. However, depending on the type of service
                    you may want to use, we may only be able to provide you with this service if certain personal data
                    is collected. For instance, we cannot process your Trip Reservation if we do not collect your name
                    and contact details.</p>
                <p>If we use automated means to process personal data which produces legal effects or significantly
                    affects you, we will implement suitable measures to safeguard you rights and freedoms, including the
                    right to obtain human intervention.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>To process your personal data as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:</h3>
            <p>In view of purpose A and B, Acme-Explorer.com relies on the legal basis that the processing of the personal
                data is necessary for the performance of a contract, specifically to finalize and administer your Trip
                Reservation. If the required personal data is not provided, Acme-Explorer.com cannot finalize the Trip
                Reservation, nor can we provide customer service. In view of purposes C to K, Acme-Explorer.com relies on its
                legitimate commercial business interest to provide its services, to prevent fraud and to improve its
                services. When using personal data to serve Acme-Explorer.com’s or a third party's legitimate interest,
                Acme-Explorer.com will always balance your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data
                against Acme-Explorer.com’s rights and interests or those of the third party. For purposes L, Acme-Explorer.com
                relies also where applicable on compliance with legal obligations (such as lawful law enforcement
                requests).
                Where needed under applicable law, Acme-Explorer.com will obtain your consent prior to processing your
                personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>If you wish to object to the processing set out under C to K and no opt-out mechanism is available to you
                directly (for example, in your account settings), to the extent applicable, please contact
                dataprotectionoffice@Acme-Explorer.com.</p>

                    <p>The Trip Provider you booked: This one’s pretty crucial for what we do! In order to complete your

                        Depending on the Trip Reservation and the Trip Provider, this can include your name, contact
                        details, payment details, the names of the guests travelling with you and any preferences or
                        other information you specified when you made your Trip Reservation. If you have a query about
                        your Trip, we may contact the Trip Provider and ask them to handle your request. Unless payment
                        is made during the book process via the Acme-Explorer.com website, we will forward your credit card
                        details to the booked Trip Provider for further handling (assuming you’ve provided us with those
                        details during your Acme-Explorer process). In cases of reservation-related disputes, we may provide
                        the Trip Provider with information about the reservation process as needed to handle the
                        dispute. This may include a copy of your reservation confirmation as proof that a Trip

                            billing collection services. When a chargeback is requested for your Trip Reservation by
                            either you or by the holder of the credit card used to make your reservation, we need to
                            share certain reservation details with the payment service provider and the relevant
                            financial institution to handle the chargeback. This may also include a copy of your

                            information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it strictly necessary for

                            relevant advertisements are shown to the right audience). We strive to only share email
                            addresses in hashed form to enable the matching of your email address with an existing
                            customer database so that your email address cannot be used for other purposes. For more

                Services and existing Trip Reservations, directing the communications via Acme-Explorer.com. This allows you
                and your Trip Provider to contact Acme-Explorer.com with questions about your Trip Reservation or about your
                accommodation partners via the My Acme-Explorer Page, the Acme-Explorer.com app, and via other channels that we make
                available.</p>
            <p>Acme-Explorer.com accesses communications and may use automated systems to review, scan, and analyze
                communications for security purposes; fraud prevention; compliance with legal and regulatory

                customer engagement, including to provide you with information and offers that we believe may be of
                interest to you; and customer or technical support. We reserve the right to block the delivery of or
                review communications that we, in our sole discretion, believe may contain malicious content, spam, or

                received using Acme-Explorer.com communication tools will be received and stored by Acme-Explorer.com. Business
                partners through whose platform you made the reservation and Trip Providers may choose to communicate

            <h2 id="policy-mobile">How does Acme-Explorer.com make use of mobile devices?</h2>
            <p>We offer free apps for a variety of mobile devices, as well as versions of our regular website that have
                been optimised for mobile and tablet browsing. These apps and mobile websites process the personal
                details you give us in much the same way as our website does – and they also allow you to use location
                services to find Trip Services nearby - if you want us to. With your consent, we may send you push
                notifications with information about your Trip Reservation. You may grant us access to your location
                data or contact details in order to provide services requested by you. When you upload a picture from
                your mobile device, your picture may also be tagged with your location information. Please read the
                instructions of your mobile device to understand how to change the settings and enable the sharing of
                such data or the receipt of push notifications.</p>
            <p>
                We make use of something known as cross-device tracking in order to optimize our services and marketing
                activities. This may be done with or without the use of cookies. For more information about cookies and

                cross-device tracking, Acme-Explorer.com is able to track user behaviour across multiple devices. As part of
                cross-device tracking, Acme-Explorer.com may combine data collected from a particular browser or mobile device
                with another computer or device linked to the computer or device from which the data was collected.

            <p>In order to optimize the content of the Acme-Explorer.com newsletter, Acme-Explorer.com combines the searches and

            <h2 id="policy-social">How does Acme-Explorer.com make use of social media?</h2>
            <p>Here at Acme-Explorer.com, we use social media in different ways. We use it partly to facilitate the use of
                online reservation services, but also to promote our Trip Providers’ travel-related products and
                services and to advertise, improve and facilitate our own services. You are free not to use the social
                media features.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Log in with your social media account. We offer you the opportunity to sign in to a Acme-Explorer.com
                        user account with your social media account, which saves you from having to remember different
                        user names and passwords for different online services. After you’ve signed in once, you’ll
                        always be able to use your social media account to sign in to your Acme-Explorer.com account. You can
                        decouple these accounts from each other at any time too.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Integration of social media plugins. We have also integrated social media plugins into the
                        Acme-Explorer.com website and apps. This means that when you click on one of the buttons (such as
                        Facebook’s ‘Like’ button) certain information is shared with these social media providers. If
                        you are logged in to your social media account at the same time, your social media provider may
                        relate this information to your social media account and possibly present your actions on your
                        social media profile to be shared with others in your network.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Other social media services and features. We may integrate other social media services (like
                        social media messaging) to interact with Acme-Explorer.com or with your contacts about our services.
                        We may maintain social media accounts and offer apps on several social media sites. Whenever you
                        connect with Acme-Explorer.com through social media, your social media service provider may allow you
                        to share information with Acme-Explorer.com. If you choose to share, you will generally be told by
                        your social media provider which information will be shared. For example, when you log into a
                        Acme-Explorer.com user account with your social media account, certain information (as authorized by
                        you to your social media provider) may be shared with Acme-Explorer.com. This might include your email
                        address, age or profile pictures saved in your user account.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p>When you register with a Acme-Explorer.com social media app or connect to a social media messaging service
                without having a Acme-Explorer.com user account, the information you choose to share with us may include the
                basic information available in your social media profile (including your email address, status updates
                and a list of your contacts). We’ll use this information to help provide you with the service you
                requested – for example, to forward a message you want to send to your contacts or to create a
                personalised user experience in the app itself or on our websites. It means that if you want us to we
                can tailor our services to suit your needs, connecting you and your friends with the best travel
                destinations and analysing and enhancing our travel-related services. Your social media provider will be
                able to tell you more about how they use and process your data whenever you connect with Acme-Explorer.com
                through them, for instance by combining personal data they collect when you use Acme-Explorer.com through them
                with information they collect when you use other online platforms linked with your social media
                provider.</p>

                <p>Whenever you use our online services, including our applications, cookies and other tracking
                    technologies can be used in various ways, such as making the Acme-Explorer.com website work, to analyse
                    traffic, or for advertisement purposes. These technologies are either used by us directly, or by our
                    business partners, including third party service providers and advertisers we work with. If you want
                    to learn more about what a cookie is, how they are used and what your choices are, please read more

                <h2 id="cookie-what">What is a cookie?</h2>
                <p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of your computer or on your mobile
                    device. So-called “first party cookies” (not as much fun as they sound) are cookies which are served
                    by the entity operating the domain through which the cookie is served. Acme-Explorer.com’s own cookies are
                    therefore “first party cookies”. In case we allow others to service cookies through the Acme-Explorer.com
                    websites and apps, these cookies are so-called “third party cookies”. </p>
                <p>In addition, there is a difference between session cookies and permanent cookies. Session cookies
                    will only exist until you close your browser. Permanent cookies have a longer lifespan and are not
                    automatically deleted once you close your browser. We strive to serve cookies or allow the serving
                    of cookies with a maximum lifespan of 5 years. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as for
                    security purposes and where absolutely necessary, will a cookie have a longer lifespan than that.
                </p>
                <p>Next to cookies, other tracking technologies are used which are similar to cookies. These can include
                    web beacons (also known as pixel tags, web bugs or gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits
                    (SDKs). A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be delivered to your
                    computer as part of a web page request, in an app, in an advertisement or in an HTML email message.
                    Pixels can be used to retrieve information from your device, such as your device type or operating
                    system, IP address, and time of visit. They are also used to serve and read cookies in your browser.
                    Tracking URLs are used to understand from which referring website the Acme-Explorer.com websites or apps
                    are used. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web
                    beacons.</p>
                <p>All these technologies are together referred to in this Cookie Statement as “cookies”.</p>

                    your searches and your previously viewed Trip Providers. We may also use cookies to remember your

                    understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications, and ensure we continue to be
                    interesting and relevant. The data we gather can include which web pages you have viewed, which

                    have viewed and the prices you have been shown.</p>

                <p>Advertising. When it comes to online advertising and marketing companies, we strive to work with
                    companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive
                    Advertising Bureau (IAB). Members of NAI and IAB adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct.
                    NAI and IAB members allow you to opt out of behavioural advertising. Visit <a

                    members that may have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer. </p>

                    tailored to your web preferences and browsing patterns.
